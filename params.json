{"name":"Chronographe","tagline":"Cross-platform timer, allowing you to start/stop the timer in order to time a task for instance... Inspired by http://joaomoreno.github.io/thyme/","body":"Chronographe\r\n============\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-----------\r\nThis is a dead simple cross-platform task timer. Dead simple because it's a dead simple system-tray icon with a dead-simple context-menu which has only few actions (Start/Stop, Show timers, quit, ...).\r\n\r\nYou need to time your task? Nothing simplier, [download the latest release](https://github.com/Max13/Chronographe/releases/latest), start it, right-click on the system-tray icon and choose your action. Be sure to read the \"known bugs\" not to be surprised. The options are implemented as ini files, an right-click action will reveal it.\r\n\r\nIf you find a bug, want a feature or want to implement a feature yourself, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/Max13/Chronographe/issues) on Github, I will see what I can do.\r\n\r\nFinally, this app was an idea from [@r8e9](https://github.com/r8e9) who needed a dead simple task timer, like [Thyme](http://joaomoreno.github.io/thyme/) but cross-platform. So I made a fair-trade with [@r8e9](https://github.com/r8e9), I needed a scanned version of the physical monopoly game, we had a deal.\r\n\r\nSupported settings\r\n------------------\r\n- **prompt_job**: When to prompt the user for the task name\r\n    - `start` (Default): On start\r\n    - `stop`: On stop\r\n    - **Note**: The timer will start/stop AFTER prompting the reason.\r\n- **timers_dir**: The directory where the timers will be saved\r\n    - Absolute path\r\n    - Relative path (default `./timers`)\r\n    - **Note**: Beginning with a dot means *relative path*\r\n- **timers_format**: The datetime format\r\n    - [`Qt::QDateTime::toString()`](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/qdatetime.html#toString) format\r\n    - `yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss` (default)\r\n- **timers_rotation**: When to rotate (change the file) the timers logs.

Usually, I do this because more advanced apps already exist on the market, and the idea is to simplify the needs not re-inventing the wheel ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n-----\r\nFirst version written in ~14 hours... Don't stop on bugs and typo immediately please ;)\r\n\r\nHave fun !\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
